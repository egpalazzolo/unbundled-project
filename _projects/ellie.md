## Introduction

Historians of Chicago have often used the "founding" and growth of the city as a device to better understand American expansion and urbanization over the course of the nienteenth century.[^1] In the last three or so decades of the nineteenth-century, a number of seminal current events prompted both reflection on the past and catalyzed interests in the future.[^2] Of course, woven around, within, and between these main events were the goings-on of everyday life - representable not least through the quotidian practices of provisioning, preparing, and consuming food. This timeline attempts to tie together major events in urban history with major events in food history in a range of facets from agricultural to fine dining.
